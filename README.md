# LaserFish

(This is a work in progress, create an issue if youd like me to configure a specific firmware for your board. Otherwise, more will be added over time)

Marlin comes preconfigured to not be very friendly with laser engravers/cutters. This is due to the frequency of it's PWM ofen being too low. Once the firmware is reconfigured to work with lasers, it often does not work for normal 3D printing any longer. This firmware solves that. So this is just custom version of Marlin configured specifically for 3D printers to be able to laser engrave/cut while still maintaining the ability to print as you normally would!

Just select the firmware that matches your board version and stepper motor drivers (If you dont know which drivers you have, selecting the correct board version typically suffices) and then install as you would normally install your firmware.
